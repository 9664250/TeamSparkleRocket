# Team Sparkle Rocket Documentation

## Team name: Team Sparkle Rockets 
(the reason we choose this name is because it fit a flashy objective like ours, aka, rocket launching).

## Robot name: Spark
(we chose this name because we thought it would match 'Team Sparkle Rockets' and be fitting for a robot).

## Team roles:
* Builders: Phineas Taylor, Graydon Neff, Santhosh Ramanathan
* Coders: Colby Greer
* Documentors: Shayla, Cassandra Knoll

### Robot Purpose Statement: 
The robot's function is to be able to pick up a rocket, place it inisde the launching area (inside the robot) and be able to launch the rocket. It will become mobile to retrieve the rocket, though the speed might be slow. For grabbing the rocket, we could use a retracting claw that would go through the middle and it would need the ability to move out of the way for the rocket to be put in place. The base of the robot should be made out of steel because it has a lot of weight making it better to grip at the ground which is higly beneficial since we need that grip while launching the rocket so the robot remains stable.

*Driving system and Chassis


* Launching mechanism and launcher housing( Ideas )

A spring-powered launcher would be a great way for the robot to launch a rocket once it has been loaded by the retractable claw. Springs are much safer than alternatives like compressed air, which could damage the launcher or even the robot itself. Despite their simplicity, springs can launch rockets over 40 feet, making them both effective and reliable. The idea is that as the retractable claw lowers the rocket into the launch tube, it also compresses the spring. Once the spring reaches a certain depth, an automatic locking mechanism engages, holding the spring in place until the rocket is ready to be launched.As for the materials used in constructing the launcher housing ( where the spring powered launcher will be in ), we plan to use PVC pipe. PVC is lightweight, affordable, easy to work with, and durable enough to safely contain the spring-powered mechanism which would be great for the robot.
