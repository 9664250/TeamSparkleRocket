## Team name: Team Sparkle Rockets 
(the reason we choose this name is because it fit a flashy objective like ours, aka, rocket launching).

## Robot name: Spark
(we chose this name because we thought it would match 'Team Sparkle Rockets' and be fitting for a robot).

## Team roles:
* Builders: Phineas Taylor, Santhosh Ramanathan
* Coders: Colby Greer (CJ)
* Documentors: Shayla, Cassandra Knoll
* Driver: Graydon Neff

### Robot Purpose Statement: 
The robot's function is to be able to pick up a rocket, place it inisde the launching area (inside the robot) and be able to launch the rocket. It will become mobile to retrieve the rocket, though the speed might be slow. For grabbing the rocket, we could use a retracting claw that would go through the middle and it would need the ability to move out of the way for the rocket to be put in place. The base of the robot should be made out of steel because it has a lot of weight making it better to grip at the ground which is higly beneficial since we need that grip while launching the rocket so the robot remains stable.

*Driving system and Chassis


* Launching mechanism and launcher housing( Written by Santhosh Ramanathan )

A spring-powered launcher would be a great way for the robot to launch a rocket once it has been loaded by the retractable claw. Springs are much safer than alternatives like compressed air, which could damage the launcher or even the robot itself. Despite their simplicity, springs can launch rockets over 40 feet, making them both effective and reliable. The idea is that as the retractable claw lowers the rocket into the launch tube, it also compresses the spring. Once the spring reaches a certain depth, an automatic locking mechanism engages, holding the spring in place until the rocket is ready to be launched.As for the materials used in constructing the launcher housing ( where the spring powered launcher will be in ), we plan to use PVC pipe. PVC is lightweight, affordable, easy to work with, and durable enough to safely contain the spring-powered mechanism which would be great for the robot.

We changed the back wheels to smaller wheels and more front traction. 

### 9/25/25

Necessary Changes:
* We need more front weight - ADD STEEL BAR IN FRONT
* Changed position of grabber - CANNOT BE IN THE BACK

End result: added 2 steel bars in front. Had to add an extra steel bar on the right side of the bot to make sure the wheel would hit the ground. The wheel now hits the ground. Fixed the wheels, which previously had the axels falling out. We added a small piece which keeps the axel in place. Our driving should be fixed now.

### 10/7/25

Necessary Changes:
* Need to complete grabber. Screw in properly, code it, and finish hopefully today.
* Need automated coding. Our coder, CJ, should be working on making our bot autonomous. We will use the grabber to grab the donut.
  
## CJ's code:
<img width="912" height="556" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-07 at 7 01 38 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/743d81b7-975f-48d6-bbe7-6505f52e07c7" />

### 10/9/25

Necessary changes: 

 * What we need is to finish the grabber, which should take 20 minutes. Then, we need to connect the code to the grabber (which currently is just a metal pole we're planning to stick into the donut hole to grab it) to be done.
 * We will have to run multiple tests to see how many turns of the motor it takes to move the "grabber" so we'll make slight changes to that.  We've ALMOST completely finished the code.
 * There will likely be a problem with driving in the same direction. We'll need to equalize the driving of our robot, maybe by adding more weight on one side?

Updted robot: (The back axel isn't conpletely working, we still need to push it in) 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/644d13f2-2461-4c39-8ba9-86ddc7c7bf24)


Plan for rocket: We need a rocket spring and we'll either buy a rocket off of Amazon or make one out of paper or another easy material.

### 10/10/25

Updates:
* Robot's automated code is functional; but not optimal. Spark leans heavily to the right side due to its added weight on the right wheel. CJ will fix by changing the motor's code.
* Spark can grab the donut with its makeshift wheel. That code part is working completely correctly AS LONG AS the donut is in the right position.
  
### 10/14/25

Updates:
* Spark is now automated without human controls
* We need to make a couple changes to the code


### 10/21/25 ( Intake Part 1 )

New goal: Find a manipulator/intake type that would work for our bot to push, scoop, pinch, or funnel an object around. Must be able to interact (pick up and hold securely) with real-world objects, specifically our rocket.

Intake type chosen: Vex V5 claw Grabber - pinches and grips the object, lifting it up and securing it. Would be useful for the rocket.

## Grabber we will be using:

## Design:

Necessary changes:
* Need to remove temporary grabber specifically meant for the donut, which Phineas is working on doing. By this class, it will be off.
* Meanwhile, Santhosh and Grayden are writing down the parts list and putting it in the section "Part list" down below.
* Santhosh will also create the Gantt Chart.
* Shayla will be drawing a design for the new robot with its new grabber.
* Cassandra will be documenting and gathering all the information to put into the github.

![CJ is doing our code.](https://github.com/9664250/TeamSparkleRocket/blob/main/driver.v5blocks)

* Part list will be found right below the items list at the top of the page.

### 10/23/25 ( Inatake Part 2 )

Updates:
* Code has been finished
* Parts list was finished
* The temporary grabber was removed and is currently being replaced by new grabber
* We have a completed plan for the robot!

### 10/28/25 ( Intake Stage 3 )

Updates: 
* Bot is almost done! Grabber is attached; have 1 c-bar left to add.
* Photo of finished robot (Phineas, Santhosh, and Graydon):
  
* <img width="1104" height="821" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-28 at 1 37 32 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e78c702-f17e-48d1-9263-a73171e9ecad" />

What was added:
* New wheel, and new axle
* C bar to protect motor from being bent by the claw.
* Tightening high strength shaft inserts since the axil was not connected fully.
* Added weight distribution to the left side since one wheel could not touch the ground.


* Code has been attached to robot. CJ's code is in the section above.


Plan:
* Then we let the driver (Graydon) practice for the rest of the period.
* Cassandra will update the driving log into the section below ("Driving Log").
* Santhosh and Phineas will be active and looking to make any changes to the robot design 
* CJ will make any changes to the code if needed.
* Shayla will help document updates/progress.
  

While working on robot, the builders encountered some issues with the wheels. One of them stopped working. We think the axle is too small and maybe fell out of the robot, so we will quickly redo that wheel by adding a new axle. Another issue is that some of the wheels don't touch the ground because of the new weight distribution due to the claw. About 4 weeks ago, we added temporary weight to the front, which may be a factor in the weight disproportion. We will remove those after the wheel is fixed, which may take a while because of the amount of added parts we have.

Driving Log (recorded by Cassandra and Shayla):
* (Records the # of trials, whether the robot was successful in grabbing the donut, whether the wheels/motors/claw worked properly, whether the robot was successful overall, and any unexpected issues that we will need to fix.)


DRIVING TRIALS

* Trial 1: The wheel stopped working. Fix the wheel!
* Trial 2: Isn't driving straight. Need to fix that. 
* Trial 3: Working well, but must drive straight! Kappite suggested we shift the grabber by 2 units.
* Trial 4: 


### 10/30/25

FINISH THE DRIVING TRIALS! They will be recorded in the section above! 

Plan: 
* Finish driving.
* As the documenters, Shayla and I will work on the Team Reflections.
* The others are done with their jobs, but will help in the recorded driving.

### 10/31//25 HALLOWEEN!

Plan for today:
* The builders have one thing to fix. They need to add the battery to the bot again because they were adjusting the bot's design yesterday and have yet to add the battery. This shouldn't take too long.
* Although the bot is still facing a huge problem of weight distribution 
* We need to do the Driver-controlled trials. They will be recorded in the section below ("Driver-controlled graded trials).

Driver-controlled graded trials:

Trial 1: No time
Trial 2: No time!! Could grab the donut, but positioning was completely wrong! Need to give driver more practice. Will spend next period helping driver practice.
Trial 3:
